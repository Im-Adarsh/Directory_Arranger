# Directory_Arranger
Java application to arrange a directory.
This is a very small application to begin with; for this version, the arrangement happens <b>based on the file's extension</b>.
I will add more features to it gradually.

<b>Important:</b>
<li>
Works on Java 8 and above environment.
Current version tested for Windows platform only.
Uses a "properties" file for generating folders at run-time. It must be placed at: "D:/Extension.properties".
Generates crash-report and log files at location: "D:/" and "D:/Arrangers" respectively.
Needs log4j2 jars (core and api) at build path.
</li>

NOTE: You may not find the UI appealing. Feel free to add your enhancements.
